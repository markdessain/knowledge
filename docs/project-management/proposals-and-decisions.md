## Introduction

Ideas and concepts need to go through a process of evaluation and debate before they can become concrete ideas. Different members of the team will have alternative insights, experience and input which can help shape ideas.

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

Once the idea has started to be formed an important document to start from the beginning is a Architecture Decision Record.

It is a living document that captures the important decisions that are taken and contains the context around the decision and the consequences of making the decision.

This document lives on well after the idea has been implemented and can finally be marked as Deprecated once a new idea takes over.

## Proposed Stage

The first stage involves an idea been proposed. This could be in the form of a short video or written documentation briefly explaining what the idea is, why it is important and what the motivation is.

At this stage it is not clear what the advantages and disadvantages are or what the cost of the idea is. The idea should not be shot down but instead questioned on its importance in the overall project and if time should be spent to investigate what is involved.

It is important to have lots of feedback from the team as this can ensure that time is not wasted pursuring an idea that will not take off.
