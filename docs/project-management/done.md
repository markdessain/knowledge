title: Definition of Done

## Introduction

When tasks are started there should be a clear and unambiguous point at which the task is considered `Done`. A failure to have this will mean that tasks will either drag on or there could be an inconsistent approach between team members.

It is not as simple as defining a single Definition of Done as tasks often fall into different buckets, some which deliver direct benefit to our customers and others which deliver benefit to the team.

## Task Types

### Research and Academic

Research tasks are based around performing studies and producing a thesis or white paper around the results. A end customer will gain no benefit from a research project but instead these are useful to be used internally within the company.

Typically once some research has been completed it can be acted upon at a later point in time.

**Definition of Done**
- [x] Documented motivation behind the research
- [x] Documented outcome of the research
- [x] Thesis or White Paper completed
- [x] Presented back to the group ([Poster Session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session]))
- [x] Peer reviewed by a team member

### Exploration and Spike

There are many unknowns in a project and before committing to completing some work it is often best to timebox a bit of time to explore the possible options. The main aim is to check if the assumptions are valid and asserting a way of working going forward before investing too much time.

**Definition of Done**
- [x] A headline summary of aim of the exploration
- [x] Documentation of what was attempted
- [x] Link to source control where exploration was done, does not need to be approved or in a main branch.
- [x] Documentation of the best next steps, stating how the team can use this new knowledge

### Deliverables

Deliverables are tasks which once released give a clear benefit to our end users. For these tasks to be completed a much higher bar is set due to it been released into a production environment. The overall goal is to make sure it is usable by our end users and it does not negativity  effect the integrity of the software project.

**Definition of Done**
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Automated tests have passed
- [x] Build pipeline is green
- [x] Peer reviewed and the technical approach approved by a team member
- [x] Signed off by the requester and / or the product owner

### Governance

Many external parties have an interest in a project from a governance point of view, this could be in the form of an audit or a architectural review to ensure that the project is in a sound condition. The outcome often is a set of actions but has no immediate impact on the customers.

**Definition of Done**
- [x] Listed criteria that needs to be met
- [x] A thumbs up or thumbs down
- [x] Documentation on what was checked
- [x] Signed off by the governing body and the product owner
- [x] Next actions defined along with severity
