Starting in August 2020 I have begun curating useful information about technologies and systems I have worked on. This could be links to interesting articles, guides to getting started or other similar material.

Use the navigation bar on the left and right to navigate around the different sections. This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
